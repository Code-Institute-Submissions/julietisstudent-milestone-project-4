# TEES - By Juliet Gardener

**Fourth Milestone Project: Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Code Institute**

TEES is an e-commerce T-Shirt web application, that allows users to search and purchase their chosen t-shirt design.
The user will be able to add their selction to the shopping cart and pay for their product using credit or debit card.
To purchase their product the user will need to log in or register an account with TEES.

## UX

My goal in the design was to create an online t-shirt sales where users could view and search for products, with the ability to purchase 
their chosen products. I wanted to create the minimalist look, so the user would not be overloaded with too much design whilst looking
at the product range. I also only included the necessary authentication mechanisms that were needed to be able to carry out the purchasing
of products to aid user productivity.
